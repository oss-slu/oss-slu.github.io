This page includes **About Us** content alongside the profiles of the **Leadership Team**.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### The Challenge \\nThe goal was to update the details of our **current** and **previous tech leads** within a markdown file. Originally, each tech lead was represented by individual `div` elements in a markdown file. As the number of tech leads grew, so did the length of the document.\\n\\n![Current Tech Leads](./experience-contributing-to-oss-20241130/current-tech-leads.jpg)\\n\\n![Previous Tech Leads](./experience-contributing-to-oss-20241130/previous-tech-leads.jpg)\\n\\n### Initial Approach\\nTo streamline this, I considered moving from plain **Markdown** to **MDX**, which allows embedding React components directly into markdown files. This switch required creating `next.config.js`, which essentially tells **Next.js** to support MDX. I crafted a `Profile` component in `src/components/people`, aiming for better maintainability by grouping react components by functionality. \\n\\n![Component Tree](./experience-contributing-to-oss-20241130/file-tree-outer.jpg)\\n\\nI replaced each static `div` with this dynamic `Profile` component within the MDX file, which seemed promising. However, this transition didn\'t reduce the overall verbosity as I had hoped. To address this, I experimented using JSX and loops directly in the MDX files, aiming to replace multiple `Profile` components with a single loop that could dynamically render each tech lead. This approach intended to simplify the document further by minimizing repetitive code. Unfortunately, this method faced limitations when dealing with intricate functionalities, emphasizing the constraints of MDX with more complex logic.\\n\\n### A Strategic Pivot\\nRealizing the limitations of directly using MDX for complex interactions, I shifted strategy. I created separate React components for the current and previous tech leads and sourced their data from JSON files \u2014 `currentGradTechLeads.json` and `prevGradTechLeads.json`. \\n\\n![JSON Data Tree](./experience-contributing-to-oss-20241130/json-data.jpg)\\n\\nThis approach allowed me to loop through the JSON data within these components, dynamically populating the `Profile` component. By consolidating all profiles under the CurrentTechLeads and PrevTechLeads components within the MDX file, I eliminated approximately 60-70 lines of code, simplifying the document structure and enhancing maintainability.\\n\\n### Understanding MDX\u2019s Power and Limitations\\nThis experience highlighted MDX\'s strengths in enriching markdown files with interactive React elements and the ease of embedding JSX directly. However, it also revealed its limitations in executing more complex conditional rendering and iterative processes. For such dynamic functionalities, external JavaScript proved to be more effective, offering greater flexibility and control over the content management and interaction logic on the page.\\n\\n### Final Touches\\nEnsuring the page\'s navigational elements remained intact was crucial, so I have tested to ensure all links and anchors functioned correctly, preserving the user experience. \\n\\n![Navigator on About Page](./experience-contributing-to-oss-20241130/navigator.jpg)\\n\\n### Reflections and Takeaways\\nThis project highlighted the evolving capabilities of web technologies like **MDX** and **React**, demonstrating their potential to transform content management. The use of MDX, coupled with React and external JSON data, provided a modular, maintainable approach that could easily be adapted or expanded by future developers.\\n\\nContributing to this project was an enriching experience, deepening my understanding of modern content management strategies and reinforcing the importance of adaptability in web development.

From refining the user interface to addressing technical challenges, this journey was filled with collaboration and problem-solving.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**What:** Completion of MVP and public launch of *Where\'s Religion*  \\n**Who:** The *Where\'s Religion* Desktop and Mobile development teams  \\n**When:** Fall Semester  \\n**Where:** Live across web and mobile platforms  \\n**Resources:** [Where\'s Religion Website](https://wheresreligion.org)\\n\\n*Where\'s Religion* is a platform that allows users to document and share multimedia annotations of places where religion is encountered in everyday life. With features like interactive mapping, multimedia uploads, and a robust search system, the app bridges faith traditions, cultural insights, and human experiences.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Highlights of Website Development**\\n\\n#### **UI and UX Enhancements**\\n\\nWe listened closely to user feedback and made significant updates to improve the app\'s design and functionality. After meeting with our client, we decided to make several changes to enhance usability and aesthetics. One of the most noticeable changes was updating the homepage and notes page backgrounds to a more vibrant color palette, giving the app a fresh and engaging look. Additionally, we modified the toolbar buttons to create a more uniform design, making them visually appealing and easier for users to navigate.\\n\\nFor onboarding, we implemented an interactive tour to help new users understand the platform. This task was also a great way to give our capstone team the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the project. We chose **Intro.js** as the library for this feature because of its popularity and ease of use. Later, we customized the CSS components of the onboarding tour to make it more visually pleasing and easy to follow, ensuring a smooth and welcoming user experience.\\n\\nIn response to feedback on the notes view, we made significant improvements to how users interact with media. We updated the media component so users can play video and audio files directly within the view, eliminating the need to click on links to access them. Additionally, based on our client\'s request, we consolidated all media upload functionalities into the editor menu control. This change streamlined the process, enabling users to upload and manage all their media files in one place.\\n\\n![Onboarding Tour Example](./wheres-religion-desktop-20241125/onboarding.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **Evolving Media Uploads**\\n\\nTo meet user needs and improve functionality, we completely overhauled the media upload feature. Users can now upload multiple files at once, making the process faster and more efficient. Additionally, we enhanced the annotation tools to allow for tagging and organizing uploads with greater flexibility, helping users manage their content more effectively.\\n\\n![Media Upload Example](./wheres-religion-desktop-20241125/media_upload.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **Archiving Instead of Deleting**\\n\\nWhile developing the app, we encountered an issue with database relationships that made data deletion problematic. Deleting records caused disconnections between related data, which compromised the app\'s functionality. To resolve this, we implemented an archiving system instead of outright deletion. This change preserved the integrity of database relationships and allowed users to restore archived data if needed, offering a robust and user-friendly solution.\\n\\n#### **Fixing Memory Leaks in Test Cases**\\n\\nAddressing memory leaks in our test cases was one of the most complex challenges we faced. Through a thorough review of previous test implementations, we identified several causes of memory leaks. Unclosed database connections were a significant issue, as were persistent global variables that prevented garbage collection. Circular references between objects and unremoved event listeners also contributed to memory retention. Additionally, timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) that were not cleared after tests caused memory to remain allocated unnecessarily.\\n\\nTo fix these issues, we ensured all database connections were properly closed, event listeners were removed, and timers were cleared after tests. Circular references were refactored to avoid retention, and global variables were scoped appropriately. We used tools such as Jest\'s `--detectLeaks` flag to identify potential memory leaks and `--detectOpenHandles` to find unclosed resources. The `--logHeapUsage` flag helped us monitor memory usage across test suites, providing insights into patterns of memory growth and areas for optimization. These efforts resulted in more reliable and efficient test cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Impact and Reflections**\\n\\nLaunching the app domain has already had a noticeable impact. Users have embraced the platform\'s capabilities, and institutions are exploring how they can leverage the tools for their communities. This success is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our teams.\\n\\n#### **Team Collaboration**\\n\\nThe Desktop and Mobile teams showcased exceptional collaboration throughout the semester. Both teams sat down with our client for live coding sessions, implementing changes in real time while receiving immediate feedback. This iterative process allowed us to refine the app\u2019s features quickly and ensure they aligned with the client\u2019s vision. Together, we also worked on creating Figma designs for the mobile app, collaborating closely with the client to compare the differences between mobile and desktop designs. A key focus during these discussions was how to effectively manage the app\'s real estate to include as many features as possible while ensuring usability across both platforms. By leveraging each team\u2019s strengths, we resolved bugs and critical issues, enabling a smooth and timely product launch.\\n\\n#### **Communication**\\n\\nEffective communication between the Desktop and Mobile teams and with our client played a pivotal role in the project\u2019s success. Regular meetings were held to discuss progress, share ideas, and address challenges collaboratively. These discussions enabled both teams to synchronize workflows, share updates on design decisions, and identify ways to integrate features across platforms seamlessly. Additionally, we presented our ideas for future app implementations to the client, incorporating their feedback to refine our roadmap. This transparent and dynamic communication process ensured that everyone involved was aligned with the project\u2019s goals and priorities.\\n\\n#### **Fostering Open Source Community**\\n\\nIn addition to launching the app, our team worked to foster a sense of community within the Open Source with SLU program. By involving the client in live feedback sessions and collaborative design discussions, we demonstrated the value of open-source principles\u2014transparency, collaboration, and user-driven development. Sharing our design choices, such as how to adapt the app\'s features to mobile platforms while maintaining functionality, also highlighted our commitment to creating a tool that serves diverse user needs. This approach not only strengthened our relationship with the client but also showcased the collaborative potential of open-source development to the broader SLU community.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Lessons Learned**\\n\\nThrough this project, we learned the importance of prioritizing user feedback and iterating quickly to address it. Building for scalability from the start allowed us to reduce technical debt and create a more robust foundation for future growth. Additionally, embracing challenges as opportunities for learning and innovation enabled us to deliver a better, more user-friendly platform.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Looking Ahead**\\n\\nWhile this semester\u2019s achievements are monumental, we are just getting started.

With the support of Dr. Eric Armbrecht, the founding director of the Global Grad initiative, Hackathon was organized by Abhilash Kotha and a dedicated team of 7 other MS students.\\n\\nAs part of the challenge, all the 18 teams tried to solve a real-time issue of grading scantron answer sheets. Orchestrated with the help of Dr. Kate Holdener and Mr. Daniel Shown, the challenge kept the participants busy for the entire duration. The prize money of $500 will be awarded to the winning team in the coming week once submissions have been reviewed.\\n\\nThroughout the day, students collaborated and put their skills to practice, benefiting from the opportunity to solve practical problems and gain hands-on experience. Dr. Holdener and Mr. Shown visited the venue to support the student teams. They interacted with teams and clarified any doubts the students had about the requirements.\\n\\nThe hackathon concluded with Dr. Armbrecht distributing certificates of participation to the teams and applauding their efforts and engagement. Feedback from participants highlighted appreciation for the practical experience and the motivation they gained from working under such conditions. Describing his experience with the event, one of the participants Ramakanth said,\\n\\n\u201cThis Hackathon was my first technical competition ever. Throughout the intense 2 hours, I learned so much from my teammates about collaborating under pressure to tackle a complex real-world problem. I am looking forward to more such events\u201d\\n\\nAny promising solutions produced as part of the students can potentially be used by Open Source with SLU in building an open source software product that automatically grades scantron answer sheets. \\n\\n![Mr. Daniel Shown explaining the requirements](./hackathon-20231127/daniel.jpg)\\n![Abhilash kotha with Dr. Eric armbrecht](./hackathon-20231127/eric_and_abhilash.JPG)\\n![Participants busy solving the problem](./hackathon-20231127/participants.JPG)\\n![One of the teams recieving a certificate](./hackathon-20231127/certificates.jpg)"},{"id":"strange-loop","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/strange-loop","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-09-21-strange-loop.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-21-strange-loop.md","title":"Strange Loop Conference","description":"The last Strange loop conference took place in Saint Louis this September and our students got the great opportunity to volunteer for the event.

The sound of 3D printers hummed in the background. On an already busy Friday afternoon these students had elected to spend their time getting some hands on experiences with open source software. \\n\\nYash Bhatia, a second year Masters student in Computer Science and a Research Assistant with Open Source with SLU, handed out USB flash drives and printed instructions. Then he went [step-by-step](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhlBWzoqiha1X8AogqNqMb4jynmaEDOAU2xmdrFD3Cc/edit?usp=sharing) with students down the path of creating a bootable flash drive with [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/). Elementry OS is a distribution of the Linux OS that touts itself as \\"The thoughtful, capable, and ethical replacement for Windows and macOS\\". Yash then walked those attending the workshop through actually using the flash drive they created as a [portable operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB). This is a technique where the user can plug and play the entire system on any desktop computer. He walked the group through a variety of use cases for a portable OS, and showed some of elementaryOS\'s capabilities as a portable operating system.\\n\\n![Yash introduces elementary OS](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_003.jpg)\\n![Students working together](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_001.jpg)\\n![Yash explaining details](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_005.jpg)\\n![Students all around the table](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_002.jpg)\\n![Yash assisting staff learning about OSS](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_004.jpg)\\n![3D printers printing in the background; possibly still printing the same job today.](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_000.jpg)"},{"id":"ossci-panel-discussion","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/ossci-panel-discussion","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-10-ossci-panel-descussion.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-10-ossci-panel-descussion.md","title":"OSSci Panel Discussion - Accelerating Scientific Discovery","description":"Members from Open-Source Science (OSSci) were at Saint Louis University and our students had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members for discussion.","date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/news/tags/announcement"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/news/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.83,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abhilash Kotha","title":"Graduate research assistant at Open Source with SLU","url":"https://github.com/AbhilashKotha","imageURL":"/img/abhilash_avatar.jpg","key":"abhilash"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"OSSci Panel Discussion - Accelerating Scientific Discovery","description":"Members from Open-Source Science (OSSci) were at Saint Louis University and our students had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members for discussion.","slug":"ossci-panel-discussion","authors":["abhilash"],"tags":["announcement","news"],"image":"./oss-ossci-20230710/panel.jpg","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Elementary OS Workshop","permalink":"/news/elementary-os"},"nextItem":{"title":"Starting Up","permalink":"/news/starting-up"}},"content":"Members from Open-Source Science (OSSci) were at Saint Louis University and our students had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members for discussion.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**What:** Hackathon<br/>\\n**Who:** [Abhilash Kotha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhilashkotha/), student in MS Computer Science and graduate research assistant at Open Source with SLU and [Raju Karmuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajukarmuri731/) alumni and tech lead at Open-Source at SLU were part of the discussion panel<br/>\\n**When:** Monday, July 10 <br/>\\n**Where:** [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/admission/visit/index.php)\\n**Resources:** [OSSci Website](https://opensource.science/)\\n\\nStudents had an incredible time as they had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members at the Open-Source Science (OSSci) event at St. Louis University!
