# Project/Product Branding and Style Guide

Building *branding and style* consistency across *projects and products*

---

## Project Title Formatting

### Primary Guidelines

All project titles should follow these core principles for maximum consistency and professional presentation.

#### Short Memorable Names

**Format**: Proper noun capitalization with original styling preserved

**Examples**:

- DroneWorld
- Where's Religion  
- Pi4Micronaut

**Rules**:

- Capitalize as proper nouns
- Preserve original capitalization decisions (DroneWorld vs Drone World)
- Maintain numbers and special characters as intended
- Keep apostrophes and punctuation in original form

#### Acronym-Based Projects

**Primary Format**: `ACRONYM: Full Expanded Name`

**Examples**:

- **IRIS**: Image Recognition Integration System
- **BAIO**: Baio (바이오) AI Output
- **DADS**: A Database of Arithmetical Dynamic Systems

**Rules**:

- Acronym always in ALL CAPS
- Colon and single space separator (`:`)
- Expanded name in Title Case (capitalize major words)
- Preserve initial articles ("A Database...", "The System...")
- Include parenthetical additions and foreign language elements
- Maintain special characters and formatting

#### Alternative Acronym Formats

For specific contexts, these variations are acceptable:

**Short Reference**: Use acronym only

- IRIS, BAIO, DADS

**Marketing/Casual**: Lead with memorable element

- Baio AI (BAIO), DroneWorld Simulation Platform

**Technical Documentation**: Full specification

- Image Recognition Integration System (IRIS) v2.1

### Mixed Project Lists

When presenting multiple projects together, group by type for visual consistency:

**Acronym Projects** (alphabetical):

- **BAIO**: Baio (바이오) AI Output
- **DADS**: A Database of Arithmetical Dynamic Systems  
- **IRIS**: Image Recognition Integration System

**Named Projects** (alphabetical):

- DroneWorld
- Pi4Micronaut
- Where's Religion

### Product Versions and Variants

When a project has multiple formats, platforms, or specialized versions, maintain consistency while clearly distinguishing between variants.

#### Format Guidelines

**Primary Format**: `ProductName PlatformType`

**Examples**:

- Shelter Volunteers Rapid Response Web
- IRIS Mobile
- BAIO Desktop
- DroneWorld API

#### Platform/Format Types

**Standard Platform Designations**:

- **Mobile** - iOS, Android, mobile web applications
- **Desktop** - Windows, macOS, Linux desktop applications  
- **Web** - Browser-based applications
- **API** - Application programming interfaces
- **CLI** - Command-line interfaces
- **Library** - Code libraries and SDKs

#### Documentation Standards

**Title Page Format**:

```
# ProductName PlatformType
*Brief descriptor of platform-specific features*

**Base Project**: [Link to main product]
**Platform**: [Specific platform details]

```

**Cross-Reference Requirements**:

- Always reference the base product in variant documentation
- Maintain links between related platform versions
- Use consistent naming across all variants

#### Multiple Platform Collections

**Project Suite Format**:
When documenting multiple platforms together:

```

**Repository/Technical Naming**:

- Use lowercase with underscores: `shelter_volunteers_mobile`
- Include platform designation: `iris_api`, `baio_desktop`
- Maintain consistency with main project naming
- **Exception**: Use hyphens when they already exist in the original name

### Core Processes

**Format**: `ACRONYM - Full Name` or creative branding

**Examples**:

- **BLA3DE** - Balanced Leadership, Allocation and Assignment, Democratic Engagement
- **KNIFE FIGHT** - Keen Negotiation In Friendly Environment - Forging Intentional Group Harmony Together

**Guidelines**:

- Use creative typography when it enhances memorability (3 for E in BLA3DE)
