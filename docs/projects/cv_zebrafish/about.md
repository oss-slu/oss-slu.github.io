## Overview

The CV Zebrafish project aims to develop an interactive, user-friendly software tool to track and analyze zebrafish body parts and movements from high-resolution, high-speed imaging data. It will integrate with machine learning outputs like DeepLabCut to process large datasets and generate detailed metrics, including speed, fin angles, movement timing, phase synchronization, and behavior classification. The modular design will make it adaptable for researchers at SLU and beyond, supporting diverse movement analysis and visualization needs in aquatic behavioral studies.

## Technical Information

### Development Priorities

#### Zebrafish Tracking and Analysis

<!-- - **From Manual Observation to Automated Analysis:** The current zebrafish tracking process often involves manual observation or semi-automated tools. This project will replace these with a fully automated, computer visionâ€“driven system.

- **Features of the Planned CV Zebrafish Tool:**  
  Includes motion tracking, behavioral pattern recognition, and data visualization to help researchers quantify zebrafish activity.

Key planned features include:   -->

<!-- - **Automated Tracking:**
  Detect and track individual zebrafish in video recordings with high accuracy.

- **Behavior Analysis:**
  Identify and log patterns such as swimming speed, direction changes, grouping behavior, and inactivity.

- **Data Visualization & Export:**
  Provide visual plots and allow exporting metrics for further statistical analysis.

- **Multi-Fish Support:**
  Handle scenarios with multiple zebrafish in the same tank without losing tracking accuracy.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  Clean, intuitive controls for loading videos, starting analysis, and reviewing results.

- **Adaptable for Research Needs:**
  Modular design to allow additional behavioral metrics or machine learning models. -->
