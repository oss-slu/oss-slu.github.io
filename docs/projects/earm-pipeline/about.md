## Technical Information

### Development Priorities

- Integrate RAG-based knowledge retrieval as part of the existing eARM framework.
- Adapt complex scientific workflows that process molecular dynamics simulations and modeling of photoactive molecules.
- Configure and deploy containerized workflows using Singularity/Apptainer and Conda on SLU HPC clusters.
- Manage workflow execution using Nextflow.
- Address dependencies including Python and Growmax, and work with semi-private source code components as needed.
