## Problem Statement

The Image Recognition Integration System is a framework for creating custom mobile applications that allow users to easily utilize existing image search machine learning models. The idea is for a developer to download this framework and be able to plug in their model API and have a mobile app up and running with minimal programming changes.  <!-- add background  --> The project is structured as a React based webapp that uses CapacitorJS to translate it into an Android/iOS app. The team chose React because we had a need from  our client to have a cross-platform mobile app; they decided to use capacitor because it is the most straightforward way to turn a React app into said cross-platorm mobile app. NextJS was chosen because the tech lead preferred it as he was quite familair with it.

## Personell and Process

The project was given to Open Source with SLU by SLU professor Dr. Abby Stylianou for the Spring 2025 semester. It was then chosen by graduate student Julian Shniter as tech lead. He chose the project because he was very familiar with the proposed tech stack and felt that he would be able to effectively lead a team of undergraduates in developing the app over the course of one semester. The project was chosen by a team of undergraduate students for their capstone project. The team included Mustafa Hashmi, Ramez Mosad and Megh Patel. Karthik was hired as a staff developer funding provided by. <!-- insert funding source --> Throughout the course of semester Julian provided technical guidance to the capstone steam and assigned them various development tasks, which they completed very well. Karthik's primary focus was designing the UX/UI and implementing it, as the rest of the team felt that was their main weakness.
