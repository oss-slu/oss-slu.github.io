## Research Software

The digital tools that enable research can take on a broad range of specific capabilities, though they tend to be some form of acquisition, automation, or analysis.

* **Acquisition** of data
    * Capture data
    * Cleaning data 
    * Managing data 

* **Automation** of processes
    * Controlling devices, spaces, & resources
    * Repeating research for verification or longitudinal studies
    * Scaling small pilots to global initiatives

* **Analysis** of information
    * Processing quantitative & qualitative analyses 
    * Modeling for simulation & prediction
    * Exploring results with visualization, monitoring, and access
