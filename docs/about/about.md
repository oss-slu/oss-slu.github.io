Open Source with SLU was established to help SLU researchers with their custom software needs, and to give students practical software development experience. The program is funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and employs Computer Science graduate students to prototype, design, and deliver open-source software to help SLU researchers and their collaborators worldwide. Undergraduate students enrolled in project-based courses work with Open Source with SLU under the mentorship of our graduate students to contribute to ongoing open source projects.

## SLU Research Team Leads

Staff from Saint Louis University's Research Computing Group have been key partners, and have even taken on the responsibility of leading teams of undergraduate students. Their work includes active open-source projects being used in academia and research. Projects involve SLU researchers across campus, regional organizations such as the Taylor Geospatial Institute, Washington University in Saint Louis, Newberry Library, the Jesuit Archives, Missouri Botanical Garden, and the St. Louis Federal Reserve. They are also involved in international open standards groups such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This team supports the popular public tools TPEN ([t-pen.org](https://t-pen.org)) and the Rerum ecosystem ([rerum.io](https://rerum.io)).

### Patrick Cuba
