# Students

## About

Teams of students form the core of our efforts developing open source software. Our initial program is structured around teams of 2-4 undergraduate Computer Science students enrolled in the capstone course. Each team of undergraduate students has an assigned Tech Lead, usually a Graduate Student and sometimes a faculty or staff member. Regular project deliverables are expected from each team. Many teams work on sustainment of existing software codebases, and sometimes teams work on new projects.
