## Swarm of Drones

![Drone](@site/static/img/drones.png)

The SLU AirCRAFT Lab has created a
software and hardware pipeline for
controlling a swarm of drones, including
virtual reality (VR) devices, a main Air
Traffic Control (ATC) center, and
numerous drones that were built in the
lab. The pipeline is currently broken, the
legacy code is out of date, and the
AirCRAFT Lab has not been able to
diagnose or repair these problems.
Currently, the main focus of our team is
to fix the pipeline to be able to control
multiple drones using VR. We are
establishing communication between
various software programs, and ensuring
that the physical connections are
properly configured. Ultimately, our goal
is to make the pipeline more robust than
it was previously, so that it doesn't break
again and can be expanded with more
drones, commands, distance, and usage.

## Network Congestion-Control Emulator

![Diagram](@site/static/img/network.png)

The purpose of this project is to create a software capable of emulating different network scenarios
while evaluating these different congestion control protocols. The software generates evaluation reports in
terms of measurement metrics such as throughput, delays and jitters.

## SALT

![Saltify](@site/static/img/saltify.png)

We look to be able to transcribe audio samples into a written format that is accepted by SALT (systematic analysis of language transcripts) software. SALT is an app that analyzes the speech of children and scores it according to their metrics.

## Mouser

![Mouse](@site/static/img/mouser.png)

Mouser is a desktop app designed to optimize research
that uses animal experimentation. Animals are often used
in experiments to analyze the effects of drugs and other
products, and Mouser is a way to optimize this analysis.
Mouser will allow researchers to manage their own
scientific experiments, where they can enter animal
measurements, configure experiment information, and
control which users can access the experiment. Using
Mouser, animals can be measured in any way based on the
user’s specifications, like weight or blood pressure, and
this data can be managed easily with the application.

## Pi4Micronaut

![Raspberry Pi](@site/static/img/raspi.png)

Our goal is to create a Java library using the
Micronaut Framework and Pi4J to streamline
the process of creating IoT web applications
which utilize hardware connectivity to
Raspberry Pi's.

## Machine Learning Code Generator

![Diagram](@site/static/img/mlcode.png)

Machine Learning is a kind of Artificial Intelligence that is used to classify and predict unknown data. It is a powerful and versatile tool, but most people cannot write machine learning code. Therefore the majority of people cannot take advantage of Machine Learning.

The goal of the project is to:

- Help people from a broad range of disciplines to make new discoveries using their own data
- Increase access to Machine Learning technologies

## Santiago

![Neuron](@site/static/img/neuron.png)

SBFSEM-tools is a MATLAB toolbox developed
by Sara Patterson for creating, analyzing and
visualizing Neuron models for the sake of
research and documentation. The project
includes multiple GUIs to interact with the data.

Our project, Santiago, aims to continue that
effort by utilizing the existing MATLAB toolbox.
In its current state, many functions of the
toolbox require researchers to edit values in the
code, which can be difficult for people without a
computer science background. Our primary goal
is to make the SBFSEM-tools more accessible to
those not familiar with computer programming
or MATLAB. We would also like to make the
existing functionality accessible within a singular
user interface.

## Scantron Software

![Scantron](@site/static/img/scantron.png)

Physical scantron machines are very slow and cost-ineffective. Our software eliminates the need for machines and makes it cost-efficient and fast.

## Seeing Is Believing

![Seeing-Is-Believing](@site/static/img/sib.png)

Seeing Is Believing is a learning management tool that allows teachers to demonstrate the pronunciation of Spanish words. Students are able to practice their pronunciation through our website and see their progress as a collection of spectrograms. The spectrograms allow students to visualize the difference between their pronunciation and the pronunciation of a native speaker even if it's difficulty for them to hear it.

## T-PEN

![Transcription](@site/static/img/tpen.png)

T‑PEN is a web-based tool for working
with images of manuscripts. Users attach
transcription data (new or uploaded) to
the actual lines of the original
manuscript in a simple, flexible interface.

## MeltShiny

![Graph](@site/static/img/graph.png)

Researchers are currently using an old program
called MeltWin to analyze DNA absorbance data.
This program was designed over 20 years ago,
requires older computer systems, and lacks newer
features. Furthermore, a lack of source code
makes modification impossible. As such there is a
need for a newer program that both includes the
functions of MeltWin, runs on modern systems,
and introduces newer “automatic” features.
