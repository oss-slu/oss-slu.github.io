            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it a 'Pi'e? Yes, we made a recipe named <strong>Pi4Micronaut</strong> with the base of Java using the ingredients like Micronaut and Pi4J. This is baked at Open Source with SLU research lab and served hot on a Raspberry Pi. Today, 3.14, we released version 1.0 into the Maven repostiry. Confused? Let me explain what is this all about.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Baking Pi4Micronaut at Open Source with SLU" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/Baking_Pi4Micronaut-f9171aefedc7e8b1908517c729bb14a1.png" width="2938" height="1959" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Pi4Micronaut, a powerful Java library designed to simplify the interaction between Java developers and electronic components connected to the Raspberry Pi. Here, we are going to explore features, benefits, and how to get started with Pi4Micronaut.</p>
<p>Pi4Micronaut is versatile and can be employed in various real-world scenarios. Some use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Automation</li>
<li>IoT Projects</li>

<p>A group of students and staff huddled over laptops around a large conference table in the Academic Technology Commons of Saint Louis University's Pius Library. The sound of 3D printers hummed in the background. On an already busy Friday afternoon these students had elected to spend their time getting some hands on experiences with open source software.</p>
<p>Yash Bhatia, a second year Masters student in Computer Science and a Research Assistant with Open Source with SLU, handed out USB flash drives and printed instructions. Then he went <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhlBWzoqiha1X8AogqNqMb4jynmaEDOAU2xmdrFD3Cc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step-by-step</a> with students down the path of creating a bootable flash drive with <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elementary OS</a>. Elementry OS is a distribution of the Linux OS that touts itself as "The thoughtful, capable, and ethical replacement for Windows and macOS". Yash then walked those attending the workshop through actually using the flash drive they created as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portable operating system</a>. This is a technique where the user can plug and play the entire system on any desktop computer. He walked the group through a variety of use cases for a portable OS, and showed some of elementaryOS's capabilities as a portable operating system.</p>
