<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-welcoming-and-diverse-community">A Welcoming and Diverse Community<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/2024/12/8/code-and-coffee#a-welcoming-and-diverse-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Welcoming and Diverse Community" title="Direct link to A Welcoming and Diverse Community">​</a></h3>
<p>The event provided a very welcoming atmosphere, with people from various backgrounds. It was incredible to meet people who have great experience in programming, each with their preferred languages, even COBOL. One person humorously shared that they hate COBOL but mentioned that we could still make a good living if we wish to get into it early though we'd probably hate every minute of it (laughs)
We met people working in different areas of tech, such as full-stack web development, machine learning, and Android development. What was great about them was the enthusiasm they had for their work. Each person spoke passionately about their current projects. It was inspiring to hear how deeply these individuals care about their work and how it motivates them.</p>

<p>As we went around introducing ourselves, we had the opportunity to share our background as a Computer Science graduate student involved in the open-source initiative at SLU. We talked about how we build and deliver open-source software to solve real-world problems. It felt great to represent a cause that’s so impactful and aligned with the values of the group</p>
<p>It was incredibly rewarding to discuss our ongoing projects and how they align with the group’s values of collaboration, creativity, and meaningful contribution. We even got to share details about some of the OSS (Open Source Software) projects we’re currently working on, receiving valuable feedback and advice in return.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="did-we-write-code-there">Did We Write Code There?<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/2024/12/8/code-and-coffee#did-we-write-code-there" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Did We Write Code There?" title="Direct link to Did We Write Code There?">​</a></h3>
<p>Not quite! While most of the event was conversational, we had engaging discussions about fun coding techniques and how to write code more efficiently using AI tools. These conversations sparked ideas about how modern tools can accelerate development and make problem-solving more dynamic. Sharing our thoughts on open-source projects led to exciting discussions about their potential applications and improvements.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creativity-in-tech">Creativity in Tech<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/2024/12/8/code-and-coffee#creativity-in-tech" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creativity in Tech" title="Direct link to Creativity in Tech">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the most interesting conversations was with a person who has seven years of industry experience but comes from an art background. He shared how tech is a medium for expressing creativity, much like art. It’s not about mastering a specific language or framework. It’s about solving problems that require creative thinking. He spoke about the satisfaction that comes when everything falls into place, like completing a piece of art.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="invaluable-encouragement">Invaluable Encouragement<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/2024/12/8/code-and-coffee#invaluable-encouragement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Invaluable Encouragement" title="Direct link to Invaluable Encouragement">​</a></h3>
<p>Everyone at the event was incredibly encouraging. Many people we spoke with appreciated the value-driven development that we’re involved in, especially since we’re working on open-source projects. As we shared our experiences and showed them our work, we felt happy to receive such positive feedback. It was helpful to receive advice and feedback from people in tech.</p>

<p>Absolutely, we’re planning to attend future meetups! Events like Code and Coffee foster both personal and professional growth. Next time, we’d love to bring more members from our OSS team or even other tech leads from SLU. It would be a great opportunity to strengthen our team bond while engaging with the local tech community.</p>

<p>Overall, attending Code and Coffee was a refreshing and inspiring experience. If you're in the tech space and want to connect with others, whether you’re working on a personal project or just want to chat, We highly recommend checking it out. It’s a great way to meet people, learn new things, and find inspiration. The event takes place every other Sunday, and you can find more details on meetup.com.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I undertook the challenge of updating the <strong>'About'</strong> page for open source with SLU at <a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/docs/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oss-slu.github.io/docs/about</a>. This page includes <strong>About Us</strong> content alongside the profiles of the <strong>Leadership Team</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-challenge">The Challenge<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/experience_contributing_to_oss-slu#the-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Challenge" title="Direct link to The Challenge">​</a></h3>
<p>The goal was to update the details of our <strong>current</strong> and <strong>previous tech leads</strong> within a markdown file. Originally, each tech lead was represented by individual <code>div</code> elements in a markdown file. As the number of tech leads grew, so did the length of the document.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Current Tech Leads" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/current-tech-leads-4582ff54ca08ce97f7dff51207225b21.jpg" width="1010" height="788" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Previous Tech Leads" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/previous-tech-leads-3d81665bfac9e3e1a3dd5b4baedca328.jpg" width="972" height="779" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="initial-approach">Initial Approach<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/experience_contributing_to_oss-slu#initial-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Initial Approach" title="Direct link to Initial Approach">​</a></h3>
<p>To streamline this, I considered moving from plain <strong>Markdown</strong> to <strong>MDX</strong>, which allows embedding React components directly into markdown files. This switch required creating <code>next.config.js</code>, which essentially tells <strong>Next.js</strong> to support MDX. I crafted a <code>Profile</code> component in <code>src/components/people</code>, aiming for better maintainability by grouping react components by functionality.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Component Tree" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/file-tree-outer-f30a20a47dcb055f639d153be0500d6d.jpg" width="359" height="158" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I replaced each static <code>div</code> with this dynamic <code>Profile</code> component within the MDX file, which seemed promising. However, this transition didn't reduce the overall verbosity as I had hoped. To address this, I experimented using JSX and loops directly in the MDX files, aiming to replace multiple <code>Profile</code> components with a single loop that could dynamically render each tech lead. This approach intended to simplify the document further by minimizing repetitive code. Unfortunately, this method faced limitations when dealing with intricate functionalities, emphasizing the constraints of MDX with more complex logic.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-strategic-pivot">A Strategic Pivot<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/experience_contributing_to_oss-slu#a-strategic-pivot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Strategic Pivot" title="Direct link to A Strategic Pivot">​</a></h3>
<p>Realizing the limitations of directly using MDX for complex interactions, I shifted strategy. I created separate React components for the current and previous tech leads and sourced their data from JSON files — <code>currentGradTechLeads.json</code> and <code>prevGradTechLeads.json</code>.</p>

<p>This approach allowed me to loop through the JSON data within these components, dynamically populating the <code>Profile</code> component. By consolidating all profiles under the CurrentTechLeads and PrevTechLeads components within the MDX file, I eliminated approximately 60-70 lines of code, simplifying the document structure and enhancing maintainability.</p>

<p>This experience highlighted MDX's strengths in enriching markdown files with interactive React elements and the ease of embedding JSX directly. However, it also revealed its limitations in executing more complex conditional rendering and iterative processes. For such dynamic functionalities, external JavaScript proved to be more effective, offering greater flexibility and control over the content management and interaction logic on the page.</p>

<p>This project highlighted the evolving capabilities of web technologies like <strong>MDX</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, demonstrating their potential to transform content management. The use of MDX, coupled with React and external JSON data, provided a modular, maintainable approach that could easily be adapted or expanded by future developers.</p>
<p>Contributing to this project was an enriching experience, deepening my understanding of modern content management strategies and reinforcing the importance of adaptability in web development.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This semester, the <em>Where's Religion</em> Desktop and Mobile teams reached an incredible milestone by completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and launching the app's domain live. From refining the user interface to addressing technical challenges, this journey was filled with collaboration and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Completion of MVP and public launch of <em>Where's Religion</em><br>
<strong>Who:</strong> The <em>Where's Religion</em> Desktop and Mobile development teams<br>
<strong>When:</strong> Fall Semester<br>
<strong>Where:</strong> Live across web and mobile platforms<br>
<strong>Resources:</strong> <a href="https://wheresreligion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where's Religion Website</a></p>
<p><em>Where's Religion</em> is a platform that allows users to document and share multimedia annotations of places where religion is encountered in everyday life. With features like interactive mapping, multimedia uploads, and a robust search system, the app bridges faith traditions, cultural insights, and human experiences.</p>

<p>We listened closely to user feedback and made significant updates to improve the app's design and functionality. After meeting with our client, we decided to make several changes to enhance usability and aesthetics. One of the most noticeable changes was updating the homepage and notes page backgrounds to a more vibrant color palette, giving the app a fresh and engaging look. Additionally, we modified the toolbar buttons to create a more uniform design, making them visually appealing and easier for users to navigate.</p>
<p>For onboarding, we implemented an interactive tour to help new users understand the platform. This task was also a great way to give our capstone team the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the project. We chose <strong>Intro.js</strong> as the library for this feature because of its popularity and ease of use. Later, we customized the CSS components of the onboarding tour to make it more visually pleasing and easy to follow, ensuring a smooth and welcoming user experience.</p>
<p>In response to feedback on the notes view, we made significant improvements to how users interact with media. We updated the media component so users can play video and audio files directly within the view, eliminating the need to click on links to access them. Additionally, based on our client's request, we consolidated all media upload functionalities into the editor menu control. This change streamlined the process, enabling users to upload and manage all their media files in one place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Onboarding Tour Example" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/onboarding-4cbb972e15f062f2287bc19b7f1b657e.jpeg" width="3024" height="1420" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolving-media-uploads"><strong>Evolving Media Uploads</strong><a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/wheres-religion-mvp#evolving-media-uploads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to evolving-media-uploads" title="Direct link to evolving-media-uploads">​</a></h4>
<p>To meet user needs and improve functionality, we completely overhauled the media upload feature. Users can now upload multiple files at once, making the process faster and more efficient. Additionally, we enhanced the annotation tools to allow for tagging and organizing uploads with greater flexibility, helping users manage their content more effectively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Media Upload Example" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/media_upload-190c7d63a3d268cfe14914257ec30dc4.jpeg" width="2372" height="1022" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="archiving-instead-of-deleting"><strong>Archiving Instead of Deleting</strong><a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/wheres-religion-mvp#archiving-instead-of-deleting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to archiving-instead-of-deleting" title="Direct link to archiving-instead-of-deleting">​</a></h4>
<p>While developing the app, we encountered an issue with database relationships that made data deletion problematic. Deleting records caused disconnections between related data, which compromised the app's functionality. To resolve this, we implemented an archiving system instead of outright deletion. This change preserved the integrity of database relationships and allowed users to restore archived data if needed, offering a robust and user-friendly solution.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fixing-memory-leaks-in-test-cases"><strong>Fixing Memory Leaks in Test Cases</strong><a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/wheres-religion-mvp#fixing-memory-leaks-in-test-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to fixing-memory-leaks-in-test-cases" title="Direct link to fixing-memory-leaks-in-test-cases">​</a></h4>
<p>Addressing memory leaks in our test cases was one of the most complex challenges we faced. Through a thorough review of previous test implementations, we identified several causes of memory leaks. Unclosed database connections were a significant issue, as were persistent global variables that prevented garbage collection. Circular references between objects and unremoved event listeners also contributed to memory retention. Additionally, timers (<code>setTimeout</code>, <code>setInterval</code>) that were not cleared after tests caused memory to remain allocated unnecessarily.</p>
<p>To fix these issues, we ensured all database connections were properly closed, event listeners were removed, and timers were cleared after tests. Circular references were refactored to avoid retention, and global variables were scoped appropriately. We used tools such as Jest's <code>--detectLeaks</code> flag to identify potential memory leaks and <code>--detectOpenHandles</code> to find unclosed resources. The <code>--logHeapUsage</code> flag helped us monitor memory usage across test suites, providing insights into patterns of memory growth and areas for optimization. These efforts resulted in more reliable and efficient test cases.</p>

<p>Smooth navigation was a major priority for the <strong>Where's Religion Mobile</strong> app. <strong>Redux state management</strong> was introduced to create a seamless, user-friendly navigation experience. The system enables real-time updates to the app's navigation state, reducing manual updates and improving responsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of Navigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Tracking</strong>: Tracks user states like <strong>"loading," "onboarding," "login," and "home"</strong> to ensure smooth user transitions.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time Navigation Updates</strong>: Navigation updates instantly as users complete actions like onboarding or logging in.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent User Flow</strong>: Smooth state transitions allow users to move seamlessly from onboarding to login and into the main app experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of the navigation system using Redux:</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insights into fostering effective and inclusive governance in open-source projects..]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open-source projects thrive on collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity. To ensure their sustainability and ethical development, well-defined governance structures are essential. I recently led a team discussion on open-source governance, focusing on key aspects like community participation, licensing, and decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Open Source Governance <br>
<strong>Who:</strong> Presented by <a href="https://github.com/Rakesh-Ranga-Buram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rakesh Ranga Buram</a>, MS student in Computer Science<br>
<strong>When:</strong> Monday, Nov 09<br>
04:10-05:10 p.m. (1 hour)<br>
<strong>Resources:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bonKjEX0R_6ltp8ujuQ9uE-MNN9n_lGJQUHYqwV_Apg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation on Open Source Governance</a></p>

<p>The discussion centered on critical governance challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who governs or owns an open-source project?</li>
<li>Which files in a repository are related to governance?</li>
<li>How should projects handle monetization to balance contributor expectations and sustainability?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="governance-structures-single-leader-vs-community-driven"><strong>Governance Structures: Single Leader vs. Community-Driven</strong><a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/blog_open_source_governance#governance-structures-single-leader-vs-community-driven" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to governance-structures-single-leader-vs-community-driven" title="Direct link to governance-structures-single-leader-vs-community-driven">​</a></h3>
<p>Governance in open-source projects can vary widely. A single-person leadership model can provide decisive direction but risks alienating contributors. Conversely, a community-driven approach fosters inclusivity and collaboration but may face challenges in decision-making efficiency. Examples like the Open Energy Dashboard (OED) highlight the benefits of decentralized governance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> "Rights revert to Beloit College in case of disputes or concerns."</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> "Revenue is reinvested into the project."</li>
<li><strong>Freedom:</strong> "By-products or reused code remain free for use, aligning with open-source principles."</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="licensing-foundation-of-open-source"><strong>Licensing: Foundation of Open Source</strong><a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/blog_open_source_governance#licensing-foundation-of-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to licensing-foundation-of-open-source" title="Direct link to licensing-foundation-of-open-source">​</a></h3>
<p>Licensing ensures clear terms of use, protecting contributors and promoting accessibility. During the session, we discussed the importance of licenses in preventing misuse or unexpected monetization, as well as encouraging innovation. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MIT License:</strong> "Permissive and widely adopted."</li>
<li><strong>GPL:</strong> "Ensures derivative works remain open source."</li>
</ul>
<p>We also touched on Contributor License Agreements (CLAs), which:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Ownership:</strong> "CLAs clarify who owns contributions, making legal processes smoother."</li>
<li><strong>Facilitate Collaboration:</strong> "They enable projects to adopt diverse contributions without legal ambiguity."</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pros-and-cons-of-clas"><strong>Pros and Cons of CLAs:</strong><a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/blog_open_source_governance#pros-and-cons-of-clas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to pros-and-cons-of-clas" title="Direct link to pros-and-cons-of-clas">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a legal framework for contributions.</li>
<li>Simplify compliance with licensing terms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Is it a 'Pi'e? Yes, we made a recipe named <strong>Pi4Micronaut</strong> with the base of Java using the ingredients like Micronaut and Pi4J. This is baked at Open Source with SLU research lab and served hot on a Raspberry Pi. Today, 3.14, we released version 1.0 into the Maven repostiry. Confused? Let me explain what is this all about.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Baking Pi4Micronaut at Open Source with SLU" src="https://oss-slu.github.io/assets/images/Baking_Pi4Micronaut-f9171aefedc7e8b1908517c729bb14a1.png" width="2938" height="1959" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Pi4Micronaut, a powerful Java library designed to simplify the interaction between Java developers and electronic components connected to the Raspberry Pi. Here, we are going to explore features, benefits, and how to get started with Pi4Micronaut.</p>
<p>Pi4Micronaut is versatile and can be employed in various real-world scenarios. Some use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Automation</li>
<li>IoT Projects</li>
<li>Educational Purposes</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-this-is-started">How this is started?<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/blog_pi4micronaut#how-this-is-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How this is started?" title="Direct link to How this is started?">​</a></h2>
<p>This project came to life with the collaboration of Open Source with SLU and Unity Foundation. Working with electronic components on the Raspberry Pi using Java has its challenges. Pi4Micronaut aims to address these challenges by providing  an efficient way for Java developers to interface with hardware connected through GPIO extension board.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-should-you-use-pi4micronaut">Why should you use Pi4Micronaut?<a href="https://oss-slu.github.io/news/blog_pi4micronaut#why-should-you-use-pi4micronaut" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why should you use Pi4Micronaut?" title="Direct link to Why should you use Pi4Micronaut?">​</a></h2>
<p>It's hard to write functionalities for an electronic components like LCD's, RFID's etc., that you want to control them using your software. We took that hardest part of the job on us and providing you the functionalities of them to directly integrate with your code.</p>
<p><em>"As a developer, I have struggled to understand how these components actually work, and implementing their functionalities has been the most difficult part of this project"</em> said Adrian Swindle, a student developer at Open Source with SLU, pointing out how hard it is to understand electrical circuits and developing appropriate functionalities to work for a component.</p>

<strong>Resources:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/slu-hackathon-2023/Get-Started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Problem Statement</a>, <a href="https://www.slu.edu/news/announcements/2023/december/global-graducate-scholars-hackaton.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLU - Newslink</a></p>
<p>On Monday the 27th of November, a Hackathon was conducted as part of a project under the Global Grad Initiative. With the support of Dr. Eric Armbrecht, the founding director of the Global Grad initiative, Hackathon was organized by Abhilash Kotha and a dedicated team of 7 other MS students.</p>
<p>As part of the challenge, all the 18 teams tried to solve a real-time issue of grading scantron answer sheets. Orchestrated with the help of Dr. Kate Holdener and Mr. Daniel Shown, the challenge kept the participants busy for the entire duration. The prize money of $500 will be awarded to the winning team in the coming week once submissions have been reviewed.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, students collaborated and put their skills to practice, benefiting from the opportunity to solve practical problems and gain hands-on experience. Dr. Holdener and Mr. Shown visited the venue to support the student teams. They interacted with teams and clarified any doubts the students had about the requirements.</p>
<p>The hackathon concluded with Dr. Armbrecht distributing certificates of participation to the teams and applauding their efforts and engagement. Feedback from participants highlighted appreciation for the practical experience and the motivation they gained from working under such conditions. Describing his experience with the event, one of the participants Ramakanth said,</p>
<p>“This Hackathon was my first technical competition ever. Throughout the intense 2 hours, I learned so much from my teammates about collaborating under pressure to tackle a complex real-world problem. I am looking forward to more such events”</p>
<p>Any promising solutions produced as part of the students can potentially be used by Open Source with SLU in building an open source software product that automatically grades scantron answer sheets.</p>

1:30-2:30 p.m. (1 hour)<br>
<strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.slu.edu/library/services/academic-technology-commons/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pius Library, ATC</a><br>

<p>A group of students and staff huddled over laptops around a large conference table in the Academic Technology Commons of Saint Louis University's Pius Library. The sound of 3D printers hummed in the background. On an already busy Friday afternoon these students had elected to spend their time getting some hands on experiences with open source software.</p>
<p>Yash Bhatia, a second year Masters student in Computer Science and a Research Assistant with Open Source with SLU, handed out USB flash drives and printed instructions. Then he went <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhlBWzoqiha1X8AogqNqMb4jynmaEDOAU2xmdrFD3Cc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step-by-step</a> with students down the path of creating a bootable flash drive with <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elementary OS</a>. Elementry OS is a distribution of the Linux OS that touts itself as "The thoughtful, capable, and ethical replacement for Windows and macOS". Yash then walked those attending the workshop through actually using the flash drive they created as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portable operating system</a>. This is a technique where the user can plug and play the entire system on any desktop computer. He walked the group through a variety of use cases for a portable OS, and showed some of elementaryOS's capabilities as a portable operating system.</p>
