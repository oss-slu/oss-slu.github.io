**Pi4Micronaut** has reached a major milestone in its development journey with the successful upgrade of its core framework from **Micronaut 3.7.3 to Micronaut 4.7.6**, along with a Gradle upgrade to **version 8.3**. This upgrade marks a significant leap forward in terms of performance, stability, and future-proofing the project for upcoming Micronaut features.

**What:** Micronaut 4.7.6 & Gradle 8.3 Upgrade Milestone  
**Who:** Led by [Yenkatarajalaxmimanohar Meda](https://github.com/yrlmanoharreddy), Tech Lead of Pi4Micronaut  
**When:** Completed on Saturday, May 2, 2025  
**Where:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oss-slu/pi4micronaut)  
**Impact:** 10 components tested across the semester, ensuring a smooth migration with no system regressions

### The Upgrade Journey

As the Tech Lead, I took full ownership of upgrading the Micronaut and Gradle versions across the entire Pi4Micronaut project. The migration wasn’t just about bumping version numbers — it involved rigorous dependency validation, compatibility checks, and module-wise regression testing. This was a **challenging task** as **Gradle wrapper issues** emerged, especially in the components folder, which needed manual fixes to align with the new version. After extensive troubleshooting, we ensured everything was aligned and working seamlessly.

In addition to the technical challenges, we also encountered the complexity of ensuring that our existing components didn't break under the new version. Each component had to undergo thorough testing to verify compatibility and performance with the upgraded stack.

To ensure a smooth transition, I coordinated with teammates and assigned component testing in each sprint. Over the course of the semester, **10 components** were thoroughly tested on the new Micronaut stack, including:

- LED
- RGB LED
- Servo Motor
- Tilt Switch
- Push Button
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Micro Switch
- PIR Sensor
  …and more.

Each successful test contributed to the confidence in the upgrade's stability. With **zero post-upgrade breakdowns**, the milestone stands as a testament to our team’s commitment to quality and maintainability.

### Code Coverage and Testing

Alongside the upgrade, we focused on improving the test coverage to ensure the reliability of Pi4Micronaut’s components. I'm proud to report that we’ve achieved **85% code coverage**, reinforcing our dedication to creating a robust and well-tested library. This coverage provides us with greater confidence in the stability of Pi4Micronaut as we continue to develop new features and refine existing ones.

_“It was a really challenging journey, but deeply rewarding. Upgrading a core framework like Micronaut without breaking a single component is a huge team win.”_ – Yenkatarajalaxmimanohar Meda

This upgrade sets the stage for the **next phase of development** — improved faster component bootstrapping, and streamlined CI/CD workflows.

Stay tuned for more updates from the Pi4Micronaut team as we continue to innovate at the intersection of Java and Raspberry Pi!
