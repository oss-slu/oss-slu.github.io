The *Rerum Playground* project, part of the Open Source with SLU initiative, recently reached several key milestones, marking its evolution as a valuable tool for researchers and educators. Through collaborative efforts and consistent development, the project is now positioned to impact both academic research and practical applications in open-source software.

## Project Overview

The *Rerum Playground* is designed to foster interactive learning and development for research software tools. It provides a testing environment where users can experiment with a range of open-source tools, helping researchers engage with computational methods without the complexity of setting up dedicated environments. This platform is built with an emphasis on ease of use, flexibility, and scalability, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of researchers and educators in the digital humanities, scientific computing, and other fields.

## Recent Milestones

### **Enhanced User Interface and New Features**
The user interface has undergone several refinements, making it more intuitive for first-time users and experienced researchers alike. Key features like the **tool selection UI**, **error handling for invalid manifests**, and **manifest metadata display** were improved based on user feedback. These updates ensure that *Rerum Playground* delivers both functionality and ease of access, creating a user-friendly experience that encourages experimentation and learning.

### **Collaboration with Research Communities**
Collaboration has been at the heart of the *Rerum Playground* project. The development team actively engages with open-source communities, academic researchers, and students from Saint Louis University to drive the project forward. Recent collaborative efforts have resulted in the addition of new tools, including the **Mirador** and **Universal Viewer**, which enhance the platform's capabilities in data visualization and analysis. These tools are critical for researchers seeking to analyze large manifests and visualize complex information.

### **Community Engagement and Open Source Contributions**
One of the projectâ€™s highlights is the active contribution from the broader open-source community. The project has received several contributions from external developers and students, which has accelerated feature development and bug fixing. Notably, improvements in tool sorting behavior were completed in recent sprints, driven by the collaborative efforts of the team and contributors.

### **Upcoming Features and Future Plans**
The *Rerum Playground* project continues to evolve. Plans are in place to integrate additional features, including the **Manifest Editor** and advanced tools for intigration. These upcoming features will further streamline the research process for users, allowing them to manage data and results more effectively. The development team remains committed to delivering a platform that adapts to the changing needs of the academic community.

## Impact on Research and Education

The *Rerum Playground* is not just a tool but an enabler of academic progress. By simplifying the integration of complex research tools, it lowers the barrier to entry for academic researchers, particularly those in fields with limited access to specialized software. The platform also promotes **interdisciplinary collaboration**, as users from various research domains can easily share tools, resources, and methodologies.

In the long term, **Rerum Playground** has the potential to support **teaching initiatives**, making it an invaluable resource for university professors and instructors. The platform can serve as a hands-on environment for students to experiment with computational research, gaining experience with real-world tools in an academic setting.

## Moving Forward

As the project matures, the **Rerum Playground** team is focusing on expanding its user base, strengthening its community, and exploring new avenues for funding and collaboration. The next steps involve scaling the platform to Manifest Editor as well as saving the work to a database by using TinyNode, integrating more tools from external contributors, and continuing to improve the user experience based on feedback from researchers and educators.

We invite other academics and developers to contribute to the project, ensuring it continues to evolve as a valuable resource for the research community.
